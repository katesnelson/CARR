# CARR - Community Assets and Relative Rurality


This is the repository for scripts related to the processing and development of the Community Assets and Relative Rurality (CARR) index. The repository also hosts a .csv file with the CARR Index and its constituent components for all census block-groups in the coterminous U.S. as calculated using data extracts from 2019. The paper on the index is now published in the Journal of Rural studies at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.12.025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.12.025).
